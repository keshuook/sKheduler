# How to install sKhedule
1. If you do not have python installed, install the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Follow the python installation instructions to install it.
3. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/keshuook/sKheduler/releases) of sKhedule and install the python installer for the one you want. (Alternatively, you can download the source code and add sKhedule to startup).
## Using the python installer
Run the installer and select the directory you want to install the app into. (Note: You might need to restart the installer).
## Using git
Go to the directory you want to install this app into and then in your terminal type:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/keshuook/sKheduler.git
```
Then go to your startup directory (which is usually in `C:\Users\(your-username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`). Here create a shortcut for the server.exe file created by git.
